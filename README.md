# QLinearDiffEqs
Code repository for research done at Brigham Young University on solving systems of linear differential equations on a quantum computer

The algorithm I used is based on this paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04553.pdf 

The algorithm for the inhomogeneous LDE follows directly after what is in that paper; I made some adaptations to that algorithm to create the algorithm for the homogeneous LDEs. 

I presented this research at the Four Corners Section of the American Physical Society on October 11, 2019 at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona.
